# üìò COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Optimization

This repository contains a decision analytics project focused on **optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in Montr√©al**.  
Using mathematical modeling and the **Gurobi Optimizer**, the project minimizes procurement, transportation, and unmet demand penalties while prioritizing high-urgency neighborhoods.

The work was completed as part of **MGSC 662 ‚Äì Decision Analytics** at McGill University.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Problem Description

Montr√©al faced the challenge of **allocating limited vaccine supply** across multiple suppliers, vaccination centers, and neighborhoods. The model addresses:

- Supply limits from 6 vaccine providers  
- Demand across 17 vaccination centers in 9 neighborhoods  
- Transportation costs  
- Public health urgency based on COVID-19 cases and deaths  
- A 5-week planning horizon (Oct‚ÄìNov 2023)  

The problem is formulated as an **unbalanced inventory optimization** with constraints on supply, demand, equity, and urgency.

## üî¢ Mathematical Model

### Decision Variable
- $X_{ijt}$: number of vaccines shipped from supplier *i* to center *j* at time *t*.  

---

### Objective Function  

Minimize total cost:

$$
Z = \sum_{i,j,t} (p_i + t_{ij}) \cdot X_{ijt} \;+\;
\sum_{n,t} (h + u_{nt}) \cdot \Big(D_{nt} - \sum_{i \in I(n), j} X_{ijt}\Big)
$$

---

### Parameters:  

- $p_i$: purchase cost  
- $t_{ij}$: transport cost  
- $h$: unmet demand penalty  
- $u_{nt}$: urgency weight (based on cases & deaths)  
- $D_{nt}$: demand in neighborhood *n* at time *t*  

---

### Constraints: 
- Supply limits per supplier  
- Demand fulfillment per neighborhood  
- Minimum 10% demand coverage in each neighborhood  
- Equal distribution within neighborhoods  
- Non-negativity
